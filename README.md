<h1>Deep Learning Guide: MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
      This project demonstrates the implementation of a deep learning model using the <strong>MNIST</strong> dataset, which contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
      The goal is to build and train a deep neural network (DNN) or convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify these images into one of the 10 digit categories.
  </p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Python</strong>: Programming language for implementing the deep learning model.</li>
      <li><strong>TensorFlow / Keras</strong>: Libraries for building and training deep learning models.</li>
      <li><strong>NumPy</strong>: For numerical computing and matrix operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Matplotlib</strong>: For visualizing the results, including training curves and predictions.</li>
      <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>: Interactive environment to run the code and showcase results.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>
  <p>
      The <strong>MNIST dataset</strong> is a widely used dataset for training image classification models. It contains:
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Training set</strong>: 60,000 images.</li>
          <li><strong>Test set</strong>: 10,000 images.</li>
      </ul>
      Each image is 28x28 pixels, normalized with pixel values between 0 and 1.

  <h2>Model Implementation</h2>
  <p>In this project, we explore the following steps:</p>

  <h3>1. Data Preprocessing</h3>
  <p>
      - Load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.<br>
      - Normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 for better model performance.<br>
      - Reshape the data to match the input shape required by the neural network.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Model Architecture</h3>
  <p>
      <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong>: A CNN is used for better performance on image-related tasks.
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Input Layer</strong>: Reshaped to fit the 28x28 pixel data.</li>
          <li><strong>Convolutional Layers</strong>: To extract features from images.</li>
          <li><strong>Max Pooling Layers</strong>: To reduce dimensionality.</li>
          <li><strong>Fully Connected Layers</strong>: To perform classification.</li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>3. Model Training</h3>
  <p>
      - Use <strong>Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss</strong> and <strong>Adam Optimizer</strong> for training the model.<br>
      - Split the data into training and validation sets.<br>
      - Track training accuracy and loss to evaluate model performance.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Model Evaluation</h3>
  <p>
      - Evaluate the model on the test set.<br>
      - Visualize predictions alongside ground truth to assess accuracy.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Model Results</h3>
  <p>
      - Achieved <strong>X%</strong> accuracy on the test set.<br>
      - Visualizations of training curves (accuracy vs. epochs) and some test predictions.
  </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
      After training the model for 5 epochs, the model achieves an accuracy of <strong>XX%</strong> on the test set.
  </p>

  <h3>Visualizations:</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Training and Validation Accuracy/Loss Curves</strong>: Plots to show how the model improves over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Predictions on Test Images</strong>: Images from the test set with predicted vs. actual labels.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <p>
      - Experiment with other architectures such as <strong>LeNet</strong>, <strong>VGG</strong>, or <strong>ResNet</strong> for potentially higher accuracy.<br>
      - Implement <strong>data augmentation</strong> techniques to improve model generalization.<br>
      - Fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) for improved performance.
